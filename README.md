Real-time code editor

FEATURES:

- Autocomplete list for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that shows up at the bottom of the text cursor position, upon finding matches as the user types.

- Real-time preview of results.

- Line and column detection:
	- The number of lines is shown on the left-hand side of the editor.
	- The current line and column numbers are displayed at the bottom.

- Includes a color picker to insert hexadecimal colors into the code (soon to support RGB, RGBA, and HSL).

- Internal system for creating, saving, loading, and deleting files using the localStorage API and BLOBs.

- System for loading and exporting files with their corresponding extensions in local storage using Blobs and FileReader.

- Text highlighting using the PrismJS library.

- Partially built using UIElements, a mini-library of my own creation for dynamically creating and deleting DOM elements and handling transitions, etc.

Currently in the process of improvement..
